OpenPipeline is an open source framework for managing animation production data and workflow.  The first implementation is a MEL-based plug-in for Autodesk Maya that handles specific aspects of production: automatic directory structures, file naming conventions, revision control, and modularity that makes multi-artist workflows possible.  Versions for other production applications are on the way.
